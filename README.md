# Sentiment-analysis
A small project on sentiment analysis with the objective to get used to tensorflow frameword and apply the newly learned concepts of LSTMs. Used a custom dataset of 4000 sentences generated using GenAI applications to include a vocabulary of about 4500 words. The sentences included about 1000 of amazon's product reviews along with general colloquial sentences. The model achived 95+ % test accuracy and performed well on custom inputs as well.
